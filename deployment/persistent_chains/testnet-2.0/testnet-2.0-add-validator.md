# Add Validator Node to Testnet 2.0

Here is the step-by-step guide for adding a Validator Node to Testnet 2.0 using `state sync` option
as described in  [Runing Node in Existing Network](../../../docs/running-node-in-existing-network.md) document:

## 1 Configure an instance

### 1.1 Ubuntu 20.04 LTS is recommended

### 1.2 (Optional) Clean up the system

> **_Note:_** Following steps are needed if you earlier version of DCL installed on the same computer

```bash
sudo systemctl stop dcld
sudo rm -f "$(which dcld)"
rm -rf "$HOME/.dcl"
```

### 1.3 Configure the firewall

* p2p and RPC (by default: `26656` and `26657` respectively) should be available for TCP connections.
  For Ubuntu:

```bash
# P2P
sudo ufw allow 26656/tcp

# RPC
sudo ufw allow 26657/tcp

# gRPC (optional)
sudo ufw allow 9090/tcp

# REST (optional)
sudo ufw allow 1317/tcp
```

* In case of IP filtering rules ensure they allow incoming and outcoming connections from/to other peers.

## 2 Download required artifacts

### 2.1 Get the release artifacts

> **_Note:_** Downloading latest release artifacts is recommended. Cosmovisor service is available only starting from DCL `v0.8.0`

```bash
curl -L -O https://github.com/zigbee-alliance/distributed-compliance-ledger/releases/download/<version>/dcld
curl -L -O https://github.com/zigbee-alliance/distributed-compliance-ledger/releases/download/<version>/cosmovisor
curl -L -O https://github.com/zigbee-alliance/distributed-compliance-ledger/releases/download/<version>/cosmovisor.service

# helper script to automate running a node
curl -L -O https://github.com/zigbee-alliance/distributed-compliance-ledger/releases/download/<release>/run_dcl_node
```

`<version>` - DCL release version (ex: `v0.9.0`)

### 2.2 Download genesis file for Testnet 2.0

```bash
curl -L -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zigbee-alliance/distributed-compliance-ledger/master/deployment/persistent_chains/testnet-2.0/genesis.json
```

### 2.3 Put `cosmovisor` binary in a folder listed in `$PATH` (e.g. `/usr/bin/`)

```bash
sudo cp ./cosmovisor /usr/bin/
sudo chmod a+x /usr/bin/cosmovisor
```

## 3 Run a Full Node using state sync

### 3.1. Initialize a node

```bash
chmod u+x ./dcld
./dcld init "<node-name>" --chain-id "testnet-2.0"
```

### 3.2 Enable state sync

Set the following `state sync` parameters under `[statesync]` section in `$HOME/.dcl/config/config.toml`

```ini
[statesync]
enable = true

rpc_servers = "https://on.test-net.dcl.csa-iot.org:26657,https://on.test-net.dcl.csa-iot.org:26657"

trust_height = <trust-height>
trust_hash = "<trust-hash>"
```

You can get `<trust-height>` and `<trust-hash>` parameters using the following command:

```bash
curl -s https://on.test-net.dcl.csa-iot.org:26657/commit | jq "{height: .result.signed_header.header.height, hash: .result.signed_header.commit.block_id.hash}"
```

### 3.3 Set Seed Node to discover peers with state sync snapshots

Set `seeds` parameter under `[p2p]` section in `$HOME/.dcl/config/config.toml`

```ini
[p2p]
seeds = "8190bf7a220892165727896ddac6e71e735babe5@100.25.175.140:26656"
```

Your validator node will use `Seed Node` to discover peers with `state sync` snapshots

### 3.4 Get `persistent_peers.txt` file

Get the latest version of `persistent_peers.txt` file, containing all other validator peer addresses, from the community (`#csa-dcl-testnet-node-admins` Slack channel) and put it to the same directory where `run_dcl_node` script is

```bash
touch persistent_peers.txt
```

### 3.5 Run the node

```bash
chmod u+x ./run_dcl_node
./run_dcl_node -c "testnet-2.0" "<node-name>"
```

### 3.6 Verify the node is running

Execute `source $HOME/.profile` to take the updated `$PATH` into effect, now
it includes the directory containing the current version of `dcld` binary (if
you have not modified or commented out the line doing the corresponding
`$PATH` assignment in `run_dcl_node` script):

```bash
source $HOME/.profile
```

Check whether `catching_up` field is set to `false` after a while using the following query:

```bash
dcld status
```

It may take couple of minutes to catch up using `state-sync` depending on how far the `statesync snapshot` was from the current state of the network

### 3.7 Check the node gets new blocks

`dcld status`. Make sure that `result.sync_info.latest_block_height` is increasing over the time (once in about 5 sec)

## 4 Make the Full Node a Validator


### 4.1 Generate NodeAdmin keys

```bash
./dcld keys add "<admin-account-name>" 2>&1 | tee "<admin-account-name>.dclkey.data"
```

IMPORTANT keep generated data (especially the mnemonic) securely.

### 4.2 Share generated address and pubkey with the community

address and pubkey can be found using

```bash
dcld keys show --output text "<admin-account-name>"
```

The information can be shared in `#csa-dcl-testnet-node-admins` Slack channel.

### 4.3 Wait until your NodeAdmin key is proposed and approved by the quorum of Testnet 2.0 trustees

Make sure the Node Admin account is proposed by a Trustee (usually CSA). The account will appear in the "Accounts" / "All Proposed Accounts" tab in https://testnet.iotledger.io/accounts.

Make sure that the proposed account is approved by at least 2/3 of Trustees. The account must disappear from the "Accounts" / "All Proposed Accounts" tab in https://testnet.iotledger.io/accounts, and appear in  "Accounts" / "All Active Accounts" tab.

### 4.4 Check the account presence on the ledger
`dcld query auth account --address="<address>"`


### 4.5 Make the node a validator

```bash
dcld tx validator add-node --pubkey="<protobuf JSON encoded validator-pubkey>" --moniker="<node-name>" --from="<admin-account-name>"
```

> **_Note:_** Get `<protobuf JSON encoded validator-pubkey>` using `dcld tendermint show-validator` command

(once transaction is successfully written you should see "code": 0 in the JSON output.)

### 4.5 Make sure the VN participates in consensus
`dcld query tendermint-validator-set` must contain the VN's address

>**_Note:_** Get your VN's address using `dcld tendermint show-address` command.


## 5 Validator Node Deployment Verification

### 5.1 Check the account presence on the ledger
`dcld query auth account --address="<address>"`

### 5.2 Check the node service is running
`systemctl status dcld`

### 5.3 Check the node gets new blocks
`dcld status`. Make sure that `result.sync_info.latest_block_height` is increasing over the time (once in about 5 sec)

### 5.4 Make sure the VN participates in consensus
`dcld query tendermint-validator-set` must contain the VN's address

>**_Note:_** Get your VN's address using `dcld tendermint show-address` command.
