# Running a DCLedger Node

This document describes in how to:

*   configure different types of DCLedger nodes: genesis, validator and observer
*   create a node administrator (or admin) account as a necessary part of validator and genesis node configuration

## Components

*   Common release artifacts:
    *   Binary artifacts (part of the release):
        *   `dcld`: The binary used for both running a node and interacting with it.
        *   `cosmovisor`: A small process manager that supports an automated process of Cosmos SDK based application upgrade (`dcld` upgrade in our case).
    *   The service configuration file `cosmovisor.service`
        (either part of the release or [deployment](../deployment) folder).
*   Additional generated data (for validators and observers):
    *   Genesis transactions file: `genesis.json`
    *   The list of alive peers: `persistent_peers.txt` with the following format: `<node id>@<ip:port>,<node2 id>@<ip:port>,...`.

Please check [Get the artifacts](#get-the-artifacts) for the details how to get them.

## Hardware requirements

Minimal:

*   1GB RAM
*   25GB of disk space
*   1.4 GHz CPU

Recommended (for highload applications):

*   2GB RAM
*   100GB SSD
*   x64 2.0 GHz 2v CPU

## Operating System

Current delivery is compiled and tested under `Ubuntu 20.04 LTS` so we recommend using this distribution for now.
In future, it will be possible to compile the application for a wide range of operating systems (thanks to Go language).

*Notes*

*   A part of the deployment commands below will try to enable and run `cosmovisor` as a systemd service, it means:
    *   that will require `sudo` for a user
    *   you may consider to use non-Ubuntu systemd systems but it's not officially supported for the moment
    *   in case non systemd system you would need to take care about `cosmovisor` service enablement and run as well

## Deployment Preparation

### (Optional) System cleanup

Required if a host has been already used in another DCLedger setup.

<details>
<summary>Cleanup (click to expand)</summary>
<p>

```bash
$ sudo systemctl stop cosmovisor
$ sudo rm -f "$(which cosmovisor)"
$ sudo systemctl stop dcld 
$ sudo rm -f "$(which dcld)"
$ rm -rf "$HOME/.dcl" 
```

*NOTE: Some of the commands above may fail depending on whether or not `cosmovisor` was used in the previous setup.*

</p>
</details>

### Get the artifacts

*   download `dcld`, `cosmovisor` and `cosmovisor.service` from GitHub [release page](https://github.com/zigbee-alliance/distributed-compliance-ledger/releases)
*   Get setup scripts either from [release page](https://github.com/zigbee-alliance/distributed-compliance-ledger/releases) or
    from [repository](../deployment/scripts) if you need latest development version.
*   (for validator and observer) Get the running DCLedegr network data:
    *   `genesis.json` can be found in a `<chain-id>` sub-directory of the [persistent_chains](../deployment/persistent_chains) folder
    *   `persistent_peers.txt`: that file may be published there as well or can be requested from the DCLedger network admins otherwise

```

</p>
</details>

### Setup DCL binaries

*   put `cosmovisor` binary in a folder listed in `$PATH` (e.g. `/usr/bin/`)
*   set a proper owner and executable permissions
*   create `$HOME/.dcl/cosmovisor/genesis/bin` directory for the genesis version of the application binary
*   copy `dcld` binary to the created directory, but do not remove it from the current working directory (to be able to perform initialization steps below)

<details>
<summary>Example for ubuntu user (click to expand)</summary>
<p>

```bash
$ sudo cp -f ./cosmovisor -t /usr/bin
$ sudo chown ubuntu /usr/bin/cosmovisor
$ sudo chmod u+x /usr/bin/cosmovisor
$ mkdir -p "$HOME/.dcl/cosmovisor/genesis/bin" 
$ cp -f ./dcld -t "$HOME/.dcl/cosmovisor/genesis/bin"
```

</p>
</details>

### Configure the firewall

*   ports `26656` (p2p) and `26657` (RPC) should be available for TCP connections
*   if you use IP filtering rules they should be in sync with the persistent peers list

<details>
<summary>Example for Ubuntu (click to expand)</summary>
<p>

```bash
$ sudo ufw allow 26656/tcp
$ sudo ufw allow 26657/tcp
```

## Genesis Validator Node

This part describes how to configure a genesis node - a starting point of any new network.

The following steps automates a set of instructions that you can find in [Running Genesis Node](advanced/running-genesis-node.md) document.

**Note** This part is not required for all validator owners: it is performed only once for the initial (genesis) node of a DCLedger network.
If you are not going to become a genesis node admin you may jump to [Validator Node](#validator-node).

### Choose the chain ID

Every network (e.g. `test-net`, `main-net` etc.) must have a unique chain ID.

### Create keys for a node admin and a trustee genesis accounts

```bash
./dcld keys add "<key-name>" 2>&1 | tee "<key-name>.dclkey.data"
```

*Notes*

*   it's improtant to keep the generated data (especially a mnemonic that allows to recover a key) in a safe place

### Setup a node

Init node:

```bash
./dcld init "<node-name>" --chain-id "<chain-id>"
```

Run node:

```bash
$ ./run_dcl_node -t genesis -c "<chain-id>" --gen-key-name "<node-admin-key>" [--gen-key-name-trustee "<trustee-key>"] "<node-name>"
```

This command:

*   generates `genesis.json` file with the following entries:
    *   a genesis account with `NodeAdmin` role
    *   (if a trustee key is provided) a genesis account with `Trustee` role
    *   a genesis txn that makes the local node a validator
*   configures and starts the node

*Notes*

*   the script assumes that:
    *   current user is going to be used for `cosmovisor` service to run as
    *   current user is in sudoers list
*   if it's not acceptable for your case please consult a less automated guide [Running Genesis Node](advanced/running-genesis-node.md)
*   you may likely want to note the summary that this script prints, in particular: node's address, public key and ID.

## Validator Node

This part describes how to configure a validator node and add it to the existing network.

The following steps automates a set of instructions that you can find in [Running Validator Node](advanced/running-validator-node.md) document

### Create a NodeAdmin account

Run the following to create a key:

```bash
./dcld keys add "<key-name>" 2>&1 | tee -a "<key-name>.dclkey.data"
```

And provide the output address and a public key to the network trustees.

*Notes*

*   it's improtant to keep the generated data (especially a mnemonic that allows to recover the key) in a safe place

### Setup a node

Init node:

```bash
./dcld init "<node-name>" --chain-id "<chain-id>"
```

Run node:

```bash
$ ./run_dcl_node -c "<chain-id>" "<node-name>"
```

*Notes*

*   the script assumes that:
    *   current user is going to be used for `cosmovisor` service to run as
    *   current user is in sudoers list
*   if it's not acceptable for your case please consult a less automated guide [Running Validator Node](advanced/running-validator-node.md)

This command:

*   properly locates `genesis.json`
*   configures and starts the node

### Ask for a ledger account

Provide generated node admin key `address` and `pubkey` to any `Trustee`(s). So they may create
an account with `NodeAdmin` role. And **wait** until:

*   Account is created
*   The node completed a catch-up:
    *   `./dcld status --node tcp://<ip:port>` returns `false` for `catching_up` field

### Make the node a validator

```bash
$ ./dcld tx validator add-node --pubkey="<validator pubkey>" --moniker="<node name>" --from="<key name>"
```

If the transaction has been successfully written you would find `"code": 0` in the output JSON.

### Notify other validator admins

Provide the node's `ID`, `IP` and a peer port (by default `26656`) to other validator admins.

*Note* Node `ID` can be found either in the output of the `run_dcl_node` script or using `./dcld status` command.

### (Optional) Create a key for a new trustee

If necessary you may also create a key to be used for a new Trustee account.

The procedure is similar to [NodeAdmin account creation](#create-a-nodeadmin-account).

## Observer Node

This part describes how to configure an observer node and add it to the existing network.

The following command automates a set of instructions that you can find in [Running Observer Node](advanced/running-observer-node.md) document

Init node:

```bash
./dcld init "<node-name>" --chain-id "<chain-id>"
```

Run node:

```bash
$ ./run_dcl_node -t observer -c "<chain-id>" "<node-name>"
```

*Notes*

*   the script assumes that:
    *   current user is going to be used for `cosmovisor` service to run as
    *   current user is in sudoers list
*   if it's not acceptable for your case please consult a less automated guide [Running Observer Node](advanced/running-observer-node.md)

### Observer Peers

The list of persistent peers for an observer is not required to match the one used by the validators.

As a general guidance you may consider to use only the peers you own and/or trust.

## Deployment Verification

*   Execute `source $HOME/.profile` to take the updated PATH into effect (it now contains the path to the current version of `dcld` binary):
    *   `source $HOME/.profile`
*   Check the account:
    *   `dcld query auth account --address="<address>"`
*   Check the node is running properly:
    *   `dcld status --node tcp://<ip:port>`
    *   The value of `<ip:port>` matches to `[rpc] laddr` field in `$HOME/.dcl/config/config.toml`
    *   Make sure that `result.sync_info.latest_block_height` is increasing over the time (once in about 5 sec).
*   Get the list of nodes participating in the consensus for the last block:
    *   `dcld query tendermint-validator-set`.
    *   You can pass the additional value to get the result for a specific height: `dcld query tendermint-validator-set 100`.

## Validator Node Maintenance

*   `persistent_peers` field in `$HOME/.dcl/config/config.toml` should include the latest version of the validators list

    *   you can use [update_peers](../deployment/scripts/update_peers)

        ```bash
        # by default path to a file is './persistent_peers'
        ./update_peers [PATH-TO-PEERS-FILE]
        ```

    *   *Notes*
        *   `cosmovisor` service should be restarted on any configuration changes
        *   in case of any IP filtering firewall rules they should be updated as well
